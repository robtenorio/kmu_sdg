 turn, lowers the cost of credit. the possibility of using reputational, traditional, and
 non-traditional collateral helps individuals and msmes gain access to finance as well
 as more favorable and competitive financing options. the wbg helps its clients and

Theme 65,Public Assets and Investment Management," public investment management (pim) involves a complex series of
                      stages involved in identifying, preparing, selecting, budgeting and implementing
                      projects and programs in the public sector. pim has been characterized as being
                      composed of eight essential functions that need to occur in the public sector but
                      may be organized or arranged somewhat differently in different
                      governments. alternatively, pim can be seen as in terms of the project cycle or
                      the series of stages involved as a project moves from being identified to being
                      implemented and evaluated as an operating project. eight key functions consist
   public assets and  of: (i) investment guidance, project development, and preliminary screening; (ii)
investment management formal project appraisal; (iii) independent review of appraisal; (iv) project
                 selection and budgeting; (v) project implementation; (vi) project adjustment; (vii)
                      facility operation and maintenance; and (viii) basic completion review and
                      evaluation. these functions or stages of pim are located in both the central and
                      service delivery agencies of government depending upon the degree of delegation
                      of functions in a government, but typically the key functions of guidelines,
                      screening, budget approvals and oversight over methods, quality of appraisal and
                      implementation performance are located in the central agencies responsible for
                      finance, budget and economic planning. service delivery agencies are typically
                      delegated functions of project identification, design and appraisal and
                      management of implementation. external review of appraisals and ex post
                      evaluation of projects and programs could be delegated to separate entities under
                      a central agency.

                         and shared prosperity. on the revenue side, subnational governments are
                         increasingly involved in resource mobilization, including taxation. on the
                         expenditure side, subnational governments have broadened and deepened their
                         responsibilities for service delivery related to water and sanitation, health,
                         education, and infrastructure, as well as local development. for subnational
                         governments to successfully deliver on their mandates, effective intergovernmental
  municipal institution  systems in fiscal and administrative areas are required. world bank activities in
     building       decentralization and intergovernmental relations will focus on: institutional and
                         fiscal frameworks, improving the capacity of subnational governments, and support
                         for service delivery and frontline providers.

Theme 73,Other Excluded Groups," social exclusion is the process in which individual of people are
               systematically blocked from (or denied full access to) various rights, opportunities and
               resources that are normally available to members of a different group, and which are
               fundamental to social integration within that particular group (e.g., housing, employment,
               healthcare, civic engagement, democratic participation, and due process).
               "
Theme 74,Participation and Civic Engagement," activities aimed at engaging citizens/beneficiaries in a two-way interaction

market-based, and publicly provided activities, and are centered on managing risk.
"
Theme 76,Social Safety Nets," activities intended to provide social assistance or social care services

                            "
Theme 78,Social Protection Delivery Systems," activities focused broadly on developing social protection and labor
                           (spl) policy and systems. country-level spl systems work at the administrative
                           and policy levels to coordinate programs across the three main sp functions:
                           resilience (mainly social insurance), equity (mainly social assistance), and
                           opportunity (mainly labor market programs). this does not include

                                  "
Theme 80,"Fragility, Conflict and Violence"," roughly speaking, fragility is defined as a risk/ vulnerability (experienced by countries) for (i) violent
conflict usually of a political nature; (ii) social and interpersonal violence; (iii) repeated political crisis that
undermine the functioning of a state or a specific local governance structure; and (iv) a general state of anomie in
which institutions (state and societal) are so dysfunctional that basic management of society and economy is not
possible. such vulnerabilities in most cases tend to create violence and conflict.
countries face multiple and overlapping forms of fragility, conflict, and violence (fcv) ‚Äì impacting all client types
‚Äì lics/mics/hics.emerging trends of fcv in the 21st century include civil conflict, subnational conflict, cross
border violence, political violence, internationalized conflict, conflict-induced forced displacement, organized
crime and trafficking, urban violence, and gender-based violence.
"
Theme 81,Conflict Prevention," conflict prevention refers to strategies used in the pre-violent phase, at
                              the front-end of the curve of conflict. they may include measures to increase trust
                              and establish predictability among the conflict parties. these strategies are intended
                              to keep disputes from escalating into violence.
                              much of wbg efforts aimed at tackling fcv do not address drivers most likely
                              affecting the absence of peace and stability. given the current risk-based approach
                              for addressing fcv, serious consideration must however, be given to the importance
 conflict prevention 
                              of the core, underlying causes of fragility and its prevention. underlying drivers of
                              fragility are often manifested in patterns of exclusion, discrimination and
                              patrimonialism and state capture by elites. horizontal inequalities, such as
                              inequitable access to political participation, land, decent employment, and public
                              services,‚Äù injustice‚Äù, ‚Äúinequality‚Äù, ‚Äúcorruption‚Äù are as significant as economic
                              drivers in conflict.
                              "
Theme 82,Post-conflict Reconstruction," post ‚Äìconflict reconstruction activities can be broadly defined as those
                     interventions 1) that focus on mainstreaming sensitivity to fcv across the wbg
                     portfolio (‚Äòdoing-no-harm‚Äô or ‚Äòdoing-some-good‚Äô); 2) activities that address the
                     direct outcomes of fcv. efforts to mainstream fcv sensitivity in the wbg‚Äôs
                     portfolio is an approach designed not necessarily to solve the fundamental
                     impediment to development and stability but rather to address a development deficit.
                     these types of wbg interventions aim to help mitigate reputational risks to the bank
                     in complex fragile, conflict and transition settings. this includes ensuring that, at
                     minimum, wbg activities ‚Äòdo no harm‚Äô in fcv environments and that, where
                     possible, projects help target conflict affected people. this is often achieved by
   post-conflict

Theme 83,Forced Displacement," interventions that address the developmental implications of forced
                          displacement for host countries, host communities and/or the displaced populations
                          (refugees and internally displaced persons). such interventions may be targeting
                          different stages of the displacement period, including preparedness/prevention in
                          advance of displacement, mitigating negative impacts during displacement or
                          facilitating solutions/resolutions for protracted situations.
                          "
Theme 84,Gender," gender refers to the social, behavioral and cultural attributes, expectations and norms associated with
being male or female. gender equality refers to how these factors determine the way in which women and men
relate to each other and to the resulting differences in power between them.
for the purposes of coding, the theme encompasses wbg activities that -- irrespective of sector -- address
and/or close gaps between males and females (for example: gaps in financial inclusion, agricultural productivity,
occupational sex segregation, gaps in participation in local service delivery management, etc.) and other gaps that
may be identified in the scd/cpf at the country level (e.g., low female labor force participation relative to male
labor force participation).
examples of coded activities:
energy
    ÔÇ∑ lao pdr rural electrification project phase 1 supported the ‚Äúpower to the poor‚Äù (p2p) program of the
         lao government. this program, implemented by electricit√© du laos (edl) is a targeted, subsidized,
         affordable, and sustainable financing mechanism for connection and indoor wiring for to the poorest rural
         households. it is designed with a gender focus to provide an interest free credit that allows the poorest rural
         households, who cannot afford to pay the entire costs of connection and internal wiring up front, to access
         the main electricity grid for basic service. the monthly payments for both the credit and electricity
         consumption are designed to be about the same as the cost for lighting by candles, diesel lamps, or car
         batteries prior to electrification. the pilot results showed that the increase in connection rate of female-
         headed households attributable to the p2p program design went from 63 percent to 90 percent.
agriculture
    ÔÇ∑ agricultural support project, c√¥te d‚Äôivoire. in c√¥te d‚Äôivoire, the cashew processing workforce is made
         up of low-skilled workers, and women are primarily engaged in shelling and peeling tasks, for which
         productivity increases steeply with tenure and experience on the job. the agricultural support project
         aims to provide training and child care in areas where new medium-sized cashew processing factories will
         be opened. starting in fy16, an impact evaluation will examine the impact of child care on women‚Äôs
         employment and productivity and on firm output.
    ÔÇ∑    levelling the field: improving opportunities for women farmers in africa, a joint world bank‚Äì
         one campaign policy report published in 2014, analyzes the factors that drive productivity gaps between
         male and female farmers and offers policy makers concrete actions to close those gaps. the report's findings
         are influencing client programs and operations. the democratic republic of congo growth poles project
         team, for example, decided to test one of the report's policy recommendation on the provision of rural child
         care to address women's child-care responsibilities and help them spend more time on agricultural work.
water
    ÔÇ∑ the indonesia second additional financing for the third water supply and sanitation for low
         income communities/community based water supply project uses several approaches to give women
         in indonesia a voice in wss decision-making. communities plan and implement wss improvements of
         their choice. the project includes rules aimed at widening community participation in decisions,
         specifically targeting women for greater project success. the project will also support mobile-based
                                                      73
         monitoring systems, gender sensitivity tools, and social audits to enhance accountability of service
        providers. the community level process makes poverty targeting and gender equity transparent and
        verifiable by all stakeholders.
entrepreneurship
    ÔÇ∑ the women entrepreneurship development project in ethiopia seeks to increase the earnings and
        employment of micro and small enterprises that are owned or partly owned by urban female entrepreneurs
        through a two-pillar approach. the first pillar tailors financial instruments to the needs of the participants
        by providing working capital and investment finance through a dedicated line of microfinance credit. this
        pillar also aims to improve the capacity of existing microfinance institutions to serve female growth-
        oriented entrepreneurs with tailored financial products. the second pillar develops the entrepreneurial and
        technical skills of the target group and supports cluster, technology, and product development for their
        businesses.
transport
    ÔÇ∑ via lilas, rio de janeiro: this transport project uses existing supervia (metropolitan train) and teleferico
        (cable car) infrastructure in rio de janeiro to provide information about violence against women and girls
        (vawg) and associated services as outlined in the maria da penha law on domestic and family violence
        through kiosks in transit stations. the via lilas kiosks provide the rail network‚Äôs 700,000 daily passengers
        with access to information for responding to violence. in approximately three minutes, women can find
        phone numbers and location details for support services, and can register to receive a text message with
        more information. initiatives like this are innovative because they build upon existing systems to
        disseminate information and to raise awareness about services available for vawg survivors. the stations
        themselves house multiple services for survivors in an attempt to make support services more accessible.
    ÔÇ∑   a survey of the liaoning urban transport project in china showed that between 70 and 80 percent of
        respondents were not auto users and had a greater need for sidewalks, secondary road repairs, and street
        lights. in general, women were more dissatisfied with the transport system than men. participatory
        consultations with women and men facilitated a dramatic change in the original urban transport project to
        include secondary road and pedestrian walkway improvements and traffic management safety measures.
ict
    ÔÇ∑   eghana: creating jobs for women in the ict industry (it enabled services, business process outsourcing).
        eghana is credited with employing women in the it industry and helping create strong ict skills among
        women and young girls employed through the project. etransform ghana, a follow-up operation, builds
        on the results of the earlier project and includes an eid component that for the first time allows women to
        be included in processes related to digital identity, obtaining credentials, and authentication, all essential
        elements to online service delivery, financial inclusion, and social protection.
gender based violence
    ÔÇ∑ the great lakes emergency sexual and gender-based violence and women's health project uses
        a multi-sectoral approach to address both the needs of survivors of sexual and gender based violence
        (sgbv) and of other vulnerable women in the targeted communities. the project aims to build solidarity
        and strengthen social cohesion as well as boost the capacity of health systems to deal with a full range of
        medical and mental health issues affecting survivors and other vulnerable women. key maternal and
        reproductive health services serve as an entry point for early identification and referral of survivors of
        sgbv, while the integrated response aims to support survivors‚Äô physical, mental, social and economic
                                                     74
          well-being. men and children will also benefit from select project activities, as survivors of sgbv, as
         family members of survivors, and in the case of men as agents of change.
examples of excluded activities:
activities that do not have a bearing or impact on gaps between males and females. for example:
    ÔÇ∑ a deposit insurance project, which aims at improving the financial and institutional capacity of a deposit
         insurance fund (such as deposit payout and overseeing the liquidation of insolvent banks).

                   another and their physical environment. these ecosystems can be forests,
                   savannas, deserts or other terrestrial environments and can also be freshwater
                   or marine. this theme is intended to capture activities whose primary purpose
                   is to directly conserve or protect biodiversity (at a genetic, species, or
                   ecosystemic level) or to support its sustainable use by human populations, as
                   well as investments which would indirectly achieve the same goals, e.g.,
