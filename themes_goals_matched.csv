management responsibility.â€
â€˜public servicesâ€™ include any service that the relevant government considers its responsibility to provide or ensure
is provided. the focus on long-term assets reflects the long-term nature of a ppp contract. for the most part this
means ppps deal with fixed assets, but may also include related long-life assets that are somewhat purpose or
site-specific, such as train rolling stock. â€˜public asset or serviceâ€™ refers to basic services where there is not a
competitive market for their provision. therefore, it excludes activities such as cell licenses, real estate and
mineral resource exploitation.
key ppp criteria:
     ï‚· public good or service.
     ï‚· operational responsibility rests with the private sector.
     ï‚· there is a legal agreement.
     ï‚· long-term contractual arrangement.
     ï‚· payments are often linked to performance.

Theme 84,Gender,Goal 5,Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls,"gender refers to the social, behavioral and cultural attributes, expectations and norms associated with
being male or female. gender equality refers to how these factors determine the way in which women and men
relate to each other and to the resulting differences in power between them.
for the purposes of coding, the theme encompasses wbg activities that -- irrespective of sector -- address
and/or close gaps between males and females (for example: gaps in financial inclusion, agricultural productivity,
occupational sex segregation, gaps in participation in local service delivery management, etc.) and other gaps that
may be identified in the scd/cpf at the country level (e.g., low female labor force participation relative to male
labor force participation).
examples of coded activities:
energy
    ï‚· lao pdr rural electrification project phase 1 supported the â€œpower to the poorâ€ (p2p) program of the
         lao government. this program, implemented by electricitÃ© du laos (edl) is a targeted, subsidized,
         affordable, and sustainable financing mechanism for connection and indoor wiring for to the poorest rural
         households. it is designed with a gender focus to provide an interest free credit that allows the poorest rural
         households, who cannot afford to pay the entire costs of connection and internal wiring up front, to access
         the main electricity grid for basic service. the monthly payments for both the credit and electricity
         consumption are designed to be about the same as the cost for lighting by candles, diesel lamps, or car
         batteries prior to electrification. the pilot results showed that the increase in connection rate of female-
         headed households attributable to the p2p program design went from 63 percent to 90 percent.
agriculture
    ï‚· agricultural support project, cÃ´te dâ€™ivoire. in cÃ´te dâ€™ivoire, the cashew processing workforce is made
         up of low-skilled workers, and women are primarily engaged in shelling and peeling tasks, for which
         productivity increases steeply with tenure and experience on the job. the agricultural support project
         aims to provide training and child care in areas where new medium-sized cashew processing factories will
         be opened. starting in fy16, an impact evaluation will examine the impact of child care on womenâ€™s
         employment and productivity and on firm output.
    ï‚·    levelling the field: improving opportunities for women farmers in africa, a joint world bankâ€“
         one campaign policy report published in 2014, analyzes the factors that drive productivity gaps between
         male and female farmers and offers policy makers concrete actions to close those gaps. the report's findings
         are influencing client programs and operations. the democratic republic of congo growth poles project
         team, for example, decided to test one of the report's policy recommendation on the provision of rural child
         care to address women's child-care responsibilities and help them spend more time on agricultural work.
water
    ï‚· the indonesia second additional financing for the third water supply and sanitation for low
         income communities/community based water supply project uses several approaches to give women
         in indonesia a voice in wss decision-making. communities plan and implement wss improvements of
         their choice. the project includes rules aimed at widening community participation in decisions,
         specifically targeting women for greater project success. the project will also support mobile-based

         monitoring systems, gender sensitivity tools, and social audits to enhance accountability of service
        providers. the community level process makes poverty targeting and gender equity transparent and
        verifiable by all stakeholders.
entrepreneurship
    ï‚· the women entrepreneurship development project in ethiopia seeks to increase the earnings and
        employment of micro and small enterprises that are owned or partly owned by urban female entrepreneurs
        through a two-pillar approach. the first pillar tailors financial instruments to the needs of the participants
        by providing working capital and investment finance through a dedicated line of microfinance credit. this
        pillar also aims to improve the capacity of existing microfinance institutions to serve female growth-
        oriented entrepreneurs with tailored financial products. the second pillar develops the entrepreneurial and
        technical skills of the target group and supports cluster, technology, and product development for their
        businesses.
transport
    ï‚· via lilas, rio de janeiro: this transport project uses existing supervia (metropolitan train) and teleferico
        (cable car) infrastructure in rio de janeiro to provide information about violence against women and girls
        (vawg) and associated services as outlined in the maria da penha law on domestic and family violence
        through kiosks in transit stations. the via lilas kiosks provide the rail networkâ€™s 700,000 daily passengers
        with access to information for responding to violence. in approximately three minutes, women can find
        phone numbers and location details for support services, and can register to receive a text message with
        more information. initiatives like this are innovative because they build upon existing systems to
        disseminate information and to raise awareness about services available for vawg survivors. the stations
        themselves house multiple services for survivors in an attempt to make support services more accessible.
    ï‚·   a survey of the liaoning urban transport project in china showed that between 70 and 80 percent of
        respondents were not auto users and had a greater need for sidewalks, secondary road repairs, and street
        lights. in general, women were more dissatisfied with the transport system than men. participatory
        consultations with women and men facilitated a dramatic change in the original urban transport project to
        include secondary road and pedestrian walkway improvements and traffic management safety measures.
ict
    ï‚·   eghana: creating jobs for women in the ict industry (it enabled services, business process outsourcing).
        eghana is credited with employing women in the it industry and helping create strong ict skills among
        women and young girls employed through the project. etransform ghana, a follow-up operation, builds
        on the results of the earlier project and includes an eid component that for the first time allows women to
        be included in processes related to digital identity, obtaining credentials, and authentication, all essential
        elements to online service delivery, financial inclusion, and social protection.
gender based violence
    ï‚· the great lakes emergency sexual and gender-based violence and women's health project uses
        a multi-sectoral approach to address both the needs of survivors of sexual and gender based violence
        (sgbv) and of other vulnerable women in the targeted communities. the project aims to build solidarity
        and strengthen social cohesion as well as boost the capacity of health systems to deal with a full range of
        medical and mental health issues affecting survivors and other vulnerable women. key maternal and
        reproductive health services serve as an entry point for early identification and referral of survivors of
        sgbv, while the integrated response aims to support survivorsâ€™ physical, mental, social and economic
                                                     74
          well-being. men and children will also benefit from select project activities, as survivors of sgbv, as
         family members of survivors, and in the case of men as agents of change.
examples of excluded activities:
